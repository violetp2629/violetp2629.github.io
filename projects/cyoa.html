            <p>The premise of this project was to create a simple game-like repository, which allowed users to follow along with a story with different branching options and endings</p>
            <p>My partner, Grace Zhu, and I named our project "murder mystery" and if the title wasn't obvious enough, the plot revolved around a mystery killing. The story takes place in the player's (you) grandparents' house
            during a wild storm. Along with the grandparents, there is also an aunt, uncle, and two cousins taking up residence at the house for the night.
            Things get harrowing however, when the grandparents are found murdered in their room. The player must make choices in order to figure out who
            the culprit is, and they are provided with hyperlinks to navigate the different options.</p>
            <p>This project did come with its challenges. For one, almost everything involved with making this required precise communication
            between my partner and I. If one of us was absent, we need to plan on who works on what via Slack and Gmail. Long distance proved to be
            much more difficult than in-person. Additionally, it was quite hard formatting how the files worked. With so many of them, it become a little
            cluttered and confusing, so we ended up having to separate them into groups, i.e. "Endings" and "Options". Despite the hardships though, this was
            a fun task to work on. I learned how to avoid merge conflicts from collaboration--waiting for my partner to push her work, pulling it,
            and then pushing my work into Github, etc etc. I also learned how to make hyperlinks within a file, by adding <code>&lt;../&gt;</code> to any
            link that was located in a parent file (one that was above the chosen file, which needed to be cd'd into). Overall, this was a very enlightening
            experience. Our project remains simple, but functional; for the future, I hope to refine it a bit more, and possibly add extra details, such as 
            images and/or CSS.</p><br>
