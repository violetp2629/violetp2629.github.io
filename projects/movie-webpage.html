            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <p>During this project, I applied all my gathered knowledge of HTML and CSS into creating an original movie poster, called "The Remnant Operation".</p>
            <p>The basic premise of the fake movie was a horror/thriller that revolved around human experimentation via augmented reality. 
             A group of people from around the world are invited to partake in a scientific investigation, with the promise of all services paid in full. However, things don't
            go as planned. Knocked unconscious, the group awakes on a desolate tree-covered island, full of dangerous tests and obstacles that will surely isolate the strong from the weak.
            The catch? The island is surrounded by a lethal forcefield, which continues to shrink. Our main characters, Wilson and V, must find a way to escape before 
            time runs out.</p>
            <p>Over the course of our work, the most difficult aspects were plot brainstorming and design. It was surpisingly difficult to come up with a solid 
            storyline; my partner and I didn't want to copy an already existing franchise, but we didn't want it to be too generic either. We ended up taking inspiration from
            several tv series, adding our own twist at the end to really personalize it. Another thing that was challenging was the actual CSS design process. Not 
            the actual coding itself, it was more revolving around *what* to do with the code. We wanted our theme to be macarbre/creepy, but still be 
            appropriate for the audience and interesting at the same time.</p>
            <p>For the future, I'm hoping to spruce up the design aspects for later projects, to make them more visually appealing.</p>
